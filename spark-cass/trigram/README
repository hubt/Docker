This project assumes the test trigram data in /root/setup.sql is loaded into the cassandra db.

The Trigram.scala program loads the cassandra table and self joins rows where the first column = the second column.

to build:

cd /root/trigram
sbt assembly

to run:

spark-submit --class Trigram /root/trigram/target/scala-2.10/trigram-spark-cass-assembly-1.0.jar
